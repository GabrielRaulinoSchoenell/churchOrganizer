ATENÇÃO::::

estou fazendo primeiramente o backend desse site, então faço o front tudo de uma vez, na minha visão, uma forma de aprimorar o processo



WARNING:::::

I'm making at first the backend for this website, I'll make the whole frontend when i finish it. I think it's a great way to improve the programming process
